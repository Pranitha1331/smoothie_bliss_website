Smoothie Bliss - Demo Site (production-ready starter)

Files:
- index.html       -> Main site with full menu, filter/search/sort, and sections
- styles.css       -> Polished responsive stylesheet
- script.js        -> Advanced filter, search, sort logic (client-side)
- images/          -> SVG placeholders for logo and 20 smoothies

How to use:
1. Unzip the archive and open index.html in a modern browser.
2. The filter buttons support multi-select (click "All" to reset).
3. Use the search box to filter by name.
4. Use the sort dropdown to order items alphabetically.

If you want PNG/JPG images instead of SVG placeholders, provide image files and replace images/*.svg.
